## Advance Systems Programming using Unix

This repository contains implementations of advanced systems programming techniques in the Linux/Unix environment. These implementations are from the coursework I completed during Spring 2024 at Columbia University. Most of the code structure is derived from homework assignments, as this was a project-based course.

The books used primarily for this course were:

- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (APUE), 3rd Edition, 2013, Addison-Wesley – by W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rago
- Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective (CSAPP), 3rd Edition, 2015, Pearson – by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O’Hallaron

Specific topics include:

- Threads and Synchronization
- Unix File Systems
- Interprocess Communication using TCP/UDP
- Processes, Virtual Memory, and Memory Allocators
- Containers, Linkers, and many more interesting concepts!

While the implementations may not always be fully optimized or may fail in some edge cases, they are intended primarily for learning purposes.

## Installation

To use the code, install the latest version of C/C++ or use a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Some implementations may not work in a Linux environment as they require a Unix-based system in some cases.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, use, and adapt the code for your purposes. If any of the implementations are my original ideas and haven't been documented elsewhere, I will include a comment indicating intellectual property.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open a pull request. I am open to any contributions that will help me improve my understanding of systems programming.
